# Assignment B4 

### This is the project for STAT 545B Assignment B4 for Johnson Chen. 

The purpose of this repository is to record my work for Assignment B4, working with a plot generation and function output

### The files included in this repository

There are three main files so far in milestone 1 release:
1. Exercise1_2.Rmd: This is the Rmarkdown file that includes the code for the entire repository.
2. Exercise1_2.md: This is the markdown file generated from the Rmarkdown file by knitting. Please see this file if you want to see the outcome of the project in a human-readable format.
3. README.md: This is the file you are reading now. This file includes the introduction of this repository and how you should approach this.
4. Exercise1_2_files: This directory contains all the plots generated by the Rmarkdown file using ggplot. They are references for the markdown file to use, and removing them would remove the plots in your readable file.

### How you should approach this repository

There are two ways that you could work with this repository: by downloading all its contents or *clone this repository*. The latter is much preferred. You could clone it by:
1. On github, go to code->clone[https] -> copy the url
